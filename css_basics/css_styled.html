                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java was the first programming language I learned. It is an Object-Oriented language. This
                            means that the language is based on "objects" which contain data, in the form of fields, and
                            code, in the form of methods. Java is also class based, the objects are instances of classes.
                            Another cool thing about Java is its ability to run on any machine after being compiled.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While learning Java, I was taught
                            data structures I could use in my programs. I learned to
                            use hash maps, linked lists, stack, queue, set, map
                            Binary Search Trees were definitely the most difficult.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Fall semester of my sophomore
                            year, I stopped playing club baseball and joined Terrapin Development and Consulting (TerpDAC).
                            TerpDAC is a technical club that solves on campus problems through technology. To help with the
                            project I was assigned to I learned python on my own and brought what I learned to the club meetings.
                            I took a big role in the modification of the code and learned even more throughout the experience.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project I was assigned to was installing
                            microphones in the library to pick up the noise level on each floor. The microphones were
                            connected to wifi and transmitted the data to a website we designed. The volume level was then
                            decided and displayed as low, medium or high.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C was the third programming language I learned. I learned the language at the University of
                        Maryland while taking <i>Introduction to Computer Systems</i>. The class was fast paced and
                        there was little time to waste when it came to completing the numerous projects. In the
                        beginning, I had some trouble with memory allocation. I would sometimes allot memory for
                        objects that didn't need it. But after some practice I caught on and figured out what
                        I was doing.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite project during that semester
                        was our <bold>Small Shell</bold> project. I used the fork() system call to duplicate the
                        process running and execute the input command. When execution of the command was complete
                        I killed the extra process and prompted the user for input again.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OCaml is the fourth programming language I
                        learned. It is the most recent language I learned and is one of my favorite. I like OCaml
                        because many of the functions written are recursive and can do a lot with a little coding.
                        <i>The Organization of Programming Languages</i> is the class that taught me OCaml.

                        a parser which interprets many of C's key words.
