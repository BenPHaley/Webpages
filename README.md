**Webpages** is a repository for all of my beginner webpages. I will be practicing
many *HTML*, *CSS*, *PHP*, and *JAVASCRIPT* techniques. The purpose of this repository
is to experiment with each language above and to build a strong base
in webpage languages.

## Goal

When I am finished uploading to this repository, I will be able to create a fully
function and interactive webpage.

## Next Step

After completing this repository, I will move on to learning *MySQL* to incorporate
a database into a webpage.
